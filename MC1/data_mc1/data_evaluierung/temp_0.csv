the u. s. there are more than 500 agrivoltaics sites producing a total of 9 gw of solar energy. these numbers are likely to grow as interest in agrivoltaics has been greatly expanding as indicated by the increase in support and funding for this sector. for example the u. s. department of agriculture ' s funding for agrivoltaics more than tripled from 2021 to 2022. farmers are able to move to more sustainable and profitable production without substantially reducing space for growing crops in fact agrivoltaics can potentially boost the production of certain shade tolerant crops by providing protection from direct sunlight while the cooler temperature below the panels reduces water evaporation. meanwhile the end consumer can feel good about choosing produce from sustainable farms. through this collaboration with rutgers university we look forward to playing our part in helping to advance the adoption of more sustainable and profitable farming practices.
