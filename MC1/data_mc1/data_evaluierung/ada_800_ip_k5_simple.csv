One of the main reasons why people are fixing solar photovoltaic  PV panels in large numbers is to help the environment but the industry is now struggling with the waste produced by 100 000 tons of panels due to be disassembled in Australia beginning in 2035. A recent study conducted at the University of South Australia has put forth a comprehensive product stewardship scheme for solar panels which the Federal Government favored several years ago

.8 million tons of high grade silicon the current value of which is USD 7.2 billion. Considering this recycling of solar PV panels has the potential to be commercially viable. Prof. Majewski believes that reusing solar panels that are still functional could yield a second hand economy. Solar panel re use offers a variety of social and environmental benefits but consumers will need guarantees that second hand panels will work properly and provide a minimum capacity in watts. Prof. Majewski believes that any end of life legislation must address both existing and new panels as well as support the development of a second hand economy. A levy on the panels could also be intended to help finance an end of life scheme.
