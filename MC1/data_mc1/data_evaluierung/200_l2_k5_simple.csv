vehicles. as this development progresses challenges are also increasing including the uneven load on the power grid and where to charge the electric vehicles. several countries including sweden denmark and germany are testing whether electric road system ers can be used to electrify road networks. an ers charges moving vehicles with either loops in or next to the road or with wires suspended

scania tests its first solar - powered trucks, sees the technology to grow : scania recently began tests on a solar powered truck a 560 horsepower plug in hybrid truck with 100 square meters of solar panels wrapping a trailer. this unique setup now being tested on public roads in sweden is a result of a two year research collaboration between scania and industry and academic partners. the project aligns seamlessly with the company ' s mission to reduce carbon emissions and redefine the future of transportation in europe. scania ' s move towards electrification has resulted in regional electrification of cargo transport industry in europe developing more bev powertrains and even allowing customers to determine how their electric trucks should be built. as early as 2020 scania and other european truck makers have agreed to end diesel engine production by 2040. the collaboration involves uppsala university trailer engineering expert eksjo maskin truck swedish solar energy company midsummer logistics company ernsts express and energy company dalakraft. "" scania ' s purpose is to drive the shift towards a sustainable transport system. never before have solar panels been used to generate energy to a truck ' s powertrain like we do in this collaboration. this natural energy source can significantly decrease emissions in the transport sector. it is great to be at the forefront in

weekend read : high time for solar – pv magazine international : cannabis prohibition drove a culture of clandestine production in the past and solar helped growers to cultivate it at remote off grid sites. now as a global commercial cannabis market emerges solar has an even bigger role to play. legal cannabis cultivation could be a big opportunity for solar. solar energy and cannabis cultivation are old bedfellows. pv pioneer john schaeffer has even credited solar with facilitating the northern california cannabis industry which in turn supported the nascent pv sector. now as the legalization of medical and recreational cannabis gathers pace solar continues to perform a key role. cannabis cultivation can take place outdoors indoors or in greenhouses. while outdoor cultivation worked for millennia the growth of the industry and increased demand for higher quality product plus tight profit margins have prompted producers to go indoors where ideal environments can be replicated. indoor growth gives control over environmental factors and flowering periods. more importantly it means consistent year round harvests. however the high powered lights and the heating ventilation and air conditioning equipment needed to control temperature and humidity come with a sasquatch sized carbon footprint. a 2022 report from the united nations office of drugs and crime unodc estimated climate control measures represent more than 80 of the carbon footprint of indoor cannabis production. unodc

of growers who operate primarily indoors fell from 80 to 60 between 2016 and 2020. with outdoor growth too inconsistent and indoor growth shrinking the hybrid option of greenhouses is likely to proliferate in the future. the cannabis industry trend of solar uptake is continuing in us states where the plant has been legalized more recently such as new york. nate verhague market development manager at new york based installer solar liberty tells pv magazine the new cannabis market "" is going to have a ton of potential for solar. "" verhague notes cannabis operations in new york state nys are only just getting up and running. "" there is going to be some extreme utility costs when it comes to electricity for these large operations "" he says. "" it is an ideal customer for solar as these facilities typically have a lot of roof space to utilize. "" while the nascent nature of the nys market means solar liberty is yet to install pv for a cannabis company verhague confirms the installer is "" in the quoting process with some organizations "" with the market looking promising from this year onward. national and regional governments the world over are shaping to follow in the footsteps of the us canada mexico thailand uruguay and others. germany could legalize cannabis completely within a few years a
