its second production facility in washington state which increased its us production capacity to 800mw and the company plans to begin commercial operation at a third project which will have a module capacity of 1. 2gw next year. similarly norsun increased its total production capacity to 1gw in 2019 following the completion of a nok230 million us 21. 6 million funding round and both companies are now keen to expand their capacity further in the us. new additions to the us solar supply chain have been considerably encouraged by the passing of last year ' s inflation reduction act which has encouraged companies to develop solar manufacturing capacity in the us so the us solar sector can reduce its reliance on imports from china. while some have suggested that many of the benefits will be more acutely felt from 2024 onwards silfab and norsun ' s announcement is an important demonstration of the growing interest in us solar development. the news also follows the publication of an encouraging report from the solar energy industries association and wood mackenzie in which the authors expect the us solar sector to add 32gw of new capacity in 2023 which would be the most in a single year in history.

in at a respectable 13. similarly iowa ranked 3 for capacity and 1 for electricity. meanwhile alabama came in at 39 for capacity and 49 for electricity with less than 1 of its kilowatts coming from wind solar and storage. that ' s not quite the whole picture in terms of low carbon energy production because alabama is among the national leaders in nuclear energy and in hydropower among eastern us states. still the prospects for growth in both of those areas are slim in alabama while green energy opportunities are ripe for the picking. to be clear it ' s not all about the politics. alabama is located in a region of the us where lower altitude wind resources are less than optimal and that can be a stumbling block. the us department of energy aims to resolve the problem by encouraging the wind industry to develop taller towers and longer blades. in the meantime the solar industry could emerge as the bright spot in alabama ' s green energy profile. just a couple of years ago alabama was down in the 50 slot for installed solar power. then it bounced up to 18 before settling into the 28th place slot last year. while a consistent trend has yet to emerge the recent activity is a promising sign. that brings us around to mercedes benz. as with many other leading global manufacturers mercedes benz is on a mission

cost of coal. therefore the state retired some coal facilities with the rest of the fleet scheduled to retire by 2036. policies also played an important role in this shift. the renewable portfolio standard rps passed via senate bill 3 in 2007 mandated that a certain percentage of the state ' s electricity must come from renewable sources. by 2021 each public utility in north carolina should ensure that 12. 5 of retail sales are generated via renewable sources. the same policy also required electric membership corporations and municipalities to provide 10 of their retail sales via renewable energy. in q1 2023 the state ' s installed solar capacity was 8 407mw ranking fourth for total installed solar capacity. however us trade body solar energy industries association seia said north carolina will only be ranked 30th in the nation for total solar deployed 1 682mw over the next five years which will drive the state down in the leaderboard.","California, Texas, and Florida","Texas, California, Florida",0.3333333333333333,0.8330453972928997,0.99999999995,0.0,0.9595599237588859,1.0,1.0,1.0
