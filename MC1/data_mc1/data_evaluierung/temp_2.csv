aircraft have been emerging at a similar pace. in december the us startup zeroavia announced that its retrofitted 19 seat dornier 228 hydrogen fuel cell electric aircraft has received permission to fly from the uk civil aviation authority. the caa permission slip validates zeroavia ' s engineering and ground testing regimen opening the gate to commercialization. the dornier builds on zeroavia ' s earlier work on a six seat electric aircraft. the initial focus is on a range of 300 miles for the 19 seater. zeroavia anticipates bumping that up to 700 miles for 40 80 seats by 2027. the new caa permit sets the stage for a series of test flights to begin in january with a conventional engine on board for safety during the initial flights. "" the 19 seat twin engine aircraft has been retrofitted in an engineering testbed configuration to incorporate zeroavia ' s hydrogen electric engine powering the propellor on its left wing operating alongside a single honeywell tpe 331 stock engine on the right for appropriate redundancy to allow the safe testing of the novel propulsion technology "" zeroavia explained in a press release. if the test flights pan out zeroavia expects to submit the paperwork for commercial versions of its za600 electric aircraft ranging from 9 to 19

not to be outdone the us army also piloted beta ' s evotl last year. the army emphasized it is not ready to place an order but they did indicate a strong interest based on the compatibility of the electric aircrafts with the army ' s climate strategy. potential benefits also include "" design flexibility reduced maintenance reduced acoustic signatures and less operations and support costs "" according to the army. as of this writing military interest in fuel cell electric aircraft appears confined to unmanned aircraft with the navy exploring a futuristic "" infinite flight "" fuel cell system powered by solar energy. follow me on trainwreck twitter tinamcasey. photo hydrogen fuel cell electric aircraft courtesy of zeroavia. tina specializes in military and corporate sustainability advanced technology emerging materials biofuels and water and wastewater issues. views expressed are her own. follow her on twitter tinamcasey and spoutible. a new cargo ship will use 100 wind energy to ferry goods between europe and the us without the carbon baggage. the us state of north dakota is among those not waiting around for the green hydrogen grass to grow under their feet. large or small heat pumps are a key pathway for rapid decarbonization. in sales pitches for methanol and ammonia for maritime fuels the numbers don ' t add up and

by the adverse effects of climate warming and that plants are not using water as efficiently as scientists might have expected. the multi faceted dynamics involved in the complex trade off between carbon gain and water loss in rising temperatures and increasing atmospheric co2 has been poorly understood. in their study recently published in the journal science researchers used satellite and micrometeorological fluxnet data and machine learning ai to develop 24 models for five major vegetation types forests shrublands savannas grasslands and croplands. they looked at potential influences and limitations in each ecosystem on co2 uptake and found the satellite driven models indicated a weakening response in plant growth and a sustained increase in plant water use since 2001 possibly due to rising vapor pressure deficit vpd the amount of water actually in the air versus the amount of water vapor the air could hold. as vpd increases it potentially slows or suppresses photosynthesis and enhances plant water consumption weakening plant growth and decreasing water use efficiency in global ecosystems. researchers say that this trend may indicate that rising temperatures related to climate change and projected increases in vpd could impact future global land carbon levels which are mostly stored in forests and other ecosystems and can affect water cycles and plant growth. they note that a number of factors were taken into consideration and the saturation of wu

"" the margins in the indoor grow operations are very competitive and chopping down one of the largest opex operating expenditure items is a great way that freedom cannabis has been able to be a leader in the industry "" debruin tells pv magazine. he says other cannabis companies have made inquiries about solar but as in the us "" it seems the clients are held back due to financing becoming harder to attain from lenders. it ' s too bad because the cost of borrowing is dwarfed by the

"" cannabis is not limited to medical and recreational use. hemp is one of the most versatile crops on the planet and it ' s making a big comeback. as hemp is not grown for psychoactive component tetrahydrocannabinol thc its farming is far less intensive and finicky than for example the high thc flower grown by canndescent in california. this makes hemp a potentially ideal agrivoltaic crop. in melz germany agrivoltaic developer sunfarming is currently trialing the cultivation of hemp under solar panels. "" all the plants without exception have grown well and developed excellently "" says rafael dulon founder and managing director of hanf farm. dulon says the panels also help with mold a key concern for hemp farmers. mold becomes a problem in autumn as temperatures cool and precipitation on the plants fails to dry. "" the rain protection for the plants provided by the pv system works wonderfully "" dulon says. another less energy intensive growing option is a greenhouse. however the need for natural sunlight makes rooftop solar less

of growers who operate primarily indoors fell from 80 to 60 between 2016 and 2020. with outdoor growth too inconsistent and indoor growth shrinking the hybrid option of greenhouses is likely to proliferate in the future. the cannabis industry trend of solar uptake is continuing in us states where the plant has been legalized more recently such as new york. nate verhague market development manager at new york based installer solar liberty tells pv magazine the new cannabis market "" is going to have a ton of potential for solar. "" verhague notes cannabis operations in new york state nys are only just getting up and running. "" there is going to be some extreme utility costs when it comes to electricity for these large operations "" he says. "" it is an ideal customer for solar as these facilities typically have a lot of roof space to utilize.

"" critically despite the changes in the state ' s energy mix overall electricity production has increased driven by renewable growth. the cec noted that alongside the growth in solar wind generation grew by 63 in the decade to 2022. total utility scale electricity generation in california increased by 3. 4 between 2021 and 2022 reaching a peak of 287. 2twh suggesting that the greater adoption of renewable energy and solar power in particular has not interfered with the state ' s ability to meet its energy demands. indeed rooftop solar capacity which is not considered as part of the utility scale figures has also increased. the state ' s domestic solar capacity increased by ten times between 2012 and 2023 and accounted for 24. 3twh of power generation in 2022 around half of the state ' s total solar capacity. strong domestic energy production has also helped california reduce its reliance on energy imports over the last decade. between 2013 and 2022 total energy imports fell from around 95twh to around 85twh peaking at close to 99twh in 2015. while 2022 reported a slight increase in energy imports from the decade ' s low of 75twh in 2019 ensuring a strong

9gw as it narrows the gap on leading state california. in q3 2021 the us utility scale solar sector recorded its best third quarter on record in terms of deployment with 3. 8gwdc added according to a report published last month by trade body the solar energy industries association seia and research firm wood mackenzie. while their study forecasts that utility scale solar will continue growing in the double digits under the current policy environment challenges related to high commodity prices and supply chain constraints are expected to hit full force throughout this year and early 2023. followed by solar the eia expects 9. 6gw of natural gas plants to be added this year 7. 6gw of wind 5. 1gw of battery storage and 2. 2gw of nuclear. forecasted battery storage deployment is an 84 increase on installs in 2021 as declining costs co locating storage with renewables generation and adding value through regional transmission organisation

florida and the midwest despite the larger populations in the latter region. while high installation costs have not deterred developers from building new projects in the north east the imbalance of solar supply and demand in the region raises questions as to the long term future of the solar sector. the regional variation demonstrated in the graph above is echoed in the distribution of new solar installations across the us. according to the eia the south where the average installation price was the lowest in 2021 added 7. 2gw of new capacity at new plants while the north east where the price was highest added just 635mw. as a result of the disparity in costs however plants in the south were relatively cost effective to build. developers spent us 10. 3 billion on new projects just over five times what was spent in the north east but installed more than eleven times as much new capacity as those in the north east. this trend is also apparent on a state level. texas dominated new capacity additions in 2021 adding 3. 6gw of new capacity ahead of florida and california which added the second and third most at 1. 2gw each and this was done in a relatively cost effective manner. the average price of solar installation in texas was us 1 367 kw well below the national average of","California, Texas, and Florida","Texas, California, Florida",0.6666666666666666,0.8330453972928997,0.699999999965,0.0,0.9595599237588859,1.0,1.0,1.0
