At a mere 7 years of age and just a few years after launching its first vehicle ( the XPeng G3 went on sales in December 2018) XPeng has wrapped up a year of sales totaling almost 100 000. In 2021 XPeng delivered 98 155 smart EVs a 263% year-over-year increase. In December 16 000 vehicles were delivered a 181% year-over-year increase compared to December 2020. There were 41 751 vehicles delivered in Q4 2021 which was a 222% year-over-year increase. Reinforcing how impressive the 98 155 delivery figure for 2021 is at the end of the year XPeng reached just 137 953 cumulative deliveries. All the more impressive XPeng’ s monthly delivery target is 15 000 vehicles and December was the second month in a row that was surpassed — and that’ s despite the global automotive chip shortage and other supply chain challenges. In the case of the P7 deliveries were up 102%. GS deliveries were up 75%. The P5 was not on the market one year ago but its sales did increase 134% month over month. XPeng also noted that its broader charging and sales network in China has been growing “ rapidly. ” It had “ 661 branded supercharging stations across 228 cities and 311 physical retail stores in operation across 121 cities as of the end of November 2021. ” All in all XPeng’ s growth seems to be rolling out as the company hoped and planned or even better.

The research house sees 13% more capacity – 46GW ( 145GWh) – than previously estimated being built given extra drive by the US Inflation Reduction Act ( IRA) which has earmarked $ 369bn for clean technologies and EU’ s REPowerEU plan which has raised ambitions to cut reliance on gas from Russia. BNEF’ s 2H 2022 Energy Storage Market Outlook estimates roughly 30GW ( 111GWh) of energy storage build through to 2030 although supply chain bottlenecks “ cloud deployment expectations until 2024 ”. In the utility-scale sector significant storage additions expected from 2025 onwards align with raised renewable targets outlined in the REPowerEU plan and a renewed focus on energy security in the UK according to BNEF which has more than doubled its estimates for deployments in the second half of this decade across Europe. In Europe Russia’ s invasion of Ukraine has impacted on energy storage developments with record electricity prices forcing consumers to consider new forms of energy supply supporting near-term growth in the residential segment. While scale-up of global energy storage capacity is imminent BNEF cautions that supply chain hurdles remain an impediment for the industry. On top of pandemic-related issues inflation high transport costs and raw material prices have made battery cells more expensive over the last year. Meanwhile projects face long lead times to finance develop and commission. So far in 2022 supply chain disruptions have resulted in lower utility-scale storage additions said BNEF noting that while a lot of these pressures would ikely ease next year scaling up for a vastly larger market in 2030 “ will certainly come with challenges ”. “ The energy storage industry is facing growing pains. Yet despite higher battery system prices demand is clear ” said Helen Kou lead author of the report and an energy storage associate at BNEF. The US and China are set to remain the two largest energy storage markets through 2030 representing more than half of global installations. “ Europe however is catching up with a significant ramp-up in capacity fuelled by the current energy crisis ” said Kou. Regionally Asia Pacific will lead storage build on a megawatt-basis by 2030 with momentum underpinned by the rapidly scaling market in China. The Americas will add more capacity on a megawatt-hour basis as storage plants in the US usually have more hours of storage. Africa Europe even with additional upside from recent policy advances and the Middle East are all set to lag Asia Pacific and the Americas according to BNEF. The firm’ s forecast suggests the majority of energy storage build by 2030 equivalent to 61% of total megawattage will be to provide so-called energy shifting – advancing or delaying the time of electricity dispatch. Co-located renewables-plus-storage projects in particular solar-plus-storage are becoming commonplace globally. BNEF noted that rapidly evolving battery technology is also driving the energy storage market. Lithium-ion batteries presently account for the majority of installations but many non-battery technologies are under development such as compressed air and thermal energy storage. Still it expects that batteries will dominate the market at least until the 2030s in large part due to their price competitiveness established supply chain and significant track record. “ If new technologies can successfully outcompete lithium-ion then total energy storage uptake may well be larger ” said Kou.

Now as a global commercial cannabis market emerges solar has an even bigger role to play. Legal cannabis cultivation could be a big opportunity for solar. Solar energy and cannabis cultivation are old bedfellows. PV pioneer John Schaeffer has even credited solar with facilitating the northern California cannabis industry which in turn supported the nascent PV sector. Now as the legalization of medical and recreational cannabis gathers pace solar continues to perform a key role. Cannabis cultivation can take place outdoors indoors or in greenhouses. While outdoor cultivation worked for millennia the growth of the industry and increased demand for higher-quality product – plus tight profit margins – have prompted producers to go indoors where ideal environments can be replicated. Indoor growth gives control over environmental factors and flowering periods. More importantly it means consistent year-round harvests. However the high-powered lights and the heating ventilation and air conditioning equipment needed to control temperature and humidity come with a Sasquatch-sized carbon footprint. A 2022 report from the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime ( UNODC) estimated climate control measures represent more than 80% of the carbon footprint of indoor cannabis production. UNODC estimated that the carbon footprint is 16 times to 100 times larger than for outdoor cultivation. Indoor “ factory farming ” is incompatible with environmental social and corporate governance ( ESG) standards says Evan Mills principal at engineering consultancy Energy Associates and a former senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Mills spelled out the problem in a paper published in “ Energy Policy ” in 2012 the year Colorado and Washington state legalized cannabis and spurred a domino effect elsewhere. Even then he estimated indoor cultivation accounted for 1% of total US electricity use for a carbon footprint equivalent to three million cars. The scientist estimated 42% of cultivators grew exclusively indoors by 2020 often in multiple sprawling Walmart-scale factories with energy consumption comparable to data centers. Unfortunately installing large scale solar on site isn’ t an easy solution. According to Mills’ recent research into a proposed indoor cannabis industrial park in Blythe California the amount of solar needed to achieve net zero energy supply would cover 1 400 acres – far more land than would be necessary if the cannabis were grown outdoors. While entirely valid Mills’ research suggests an erroneous equivalency between indoor- and outdoor-grown cannabis. After all anyone can brew up a big batch of moonshine in a bathtub but it’ s not so easy to produce a fine single-malt Scotch at scale. Indoor cannabis is a premium product and in a state like California where people can still easily access a black market at least double the size of the regulated ( and taxable) industry commercial cannabis companies are incentivized to produce premium products only cultivable in a climate-controlled environment. Large-scale outdoor farming is also fraught with risk. In October or “ Croptober ” as it is known all of California’ s outdoor-grown cannabis is harvested. This single harvest if it has not been spoiled by environmental impacts such as wildfires is only attractive for consumers for several months. If the crop fails or people decide to use cannabis in the other nine months of the year well they’ ll turn to an indoor site or greenhouse. Despite the alarming energy intensity of indoor cultivation the sheer roofspace of grow houses is an ideal solar platform. California-based Canndescent boasts more than 100 000 square feet of indoor cultivation space and annually produces almost 17 tons of cannabis. In 2019 Canndescent installed a 282.5 kW solar system at its facility in Desert Hot Springs. Canndescent Senior Director of Compliance Andrew Mochulsky tells pv magazine the Colorado Desert’ s unrelenting sunshine and limited cloud cover make solar a no-brainer. “ We’ re in the heart of solar and wind country so it made sense to bring solar online ” he says. “ We also think it’ s just the right thing to do. ” Indoor cultivation Mochulsky says is “ not trying to replace the sun but improve upon it to create rigid 12-hour midday sun conditions which are physically impossible outside. Because of that you have to control the environment so it’ s very thirsty for electricity. ” Canndescent’ s solar offsets 25% to 35% of the company’ s electricity consumption according to Mochulsky depending on the time of year. “ It’ s a great investment ” he adds. “ And if we can get closer to a 1:1 ratio of canopy space it would have a substantial impact on our power costs. ” The inclusion of solar shades and carports also provides a “ quality of life benefit ” for employees Mochulsky says. “ So people have a nice shaded place to sit. ” Despite such benefits only a small minority of North American indoor growers have gone solar. “ We are an outlier ” says Mochulsky. “ I can not say that it is the norm. Even here in Desert Hot Springs we are the only one and that is in sharp contrast to the residential market where every rooftop has solar on it. Solar makes abundant sense but it entails a cost upfront. ” The Canndescent director says tight cannabis margins are a factor. “ Even with an ROI [ return on investment for solar ] of five years the market is soft [ costs ] are low – except to operate – and the liquidity is very tight. ” While cannabis legalization in the US is progressing state by state and president Joe Biden has directed his secretary of health and human services and the attorney general to review cannabis scheduling under federal law the market remains in legal limbo at national level making financing solar difficult. “ There are a lot of prevailing headwinds for cannabis to adopt more solar ” says Mochulsky. “ Access to a lot of financial instruments is just not available. We can not get a standard loan from the standard banks. We can’ t for example mortgage a company. Cannabis companies don’ t have availability to things like bankruptcy. Federal illegality also means we don’ t have access to state and federal tax-credit programs [ such as the Inflation Reduction Act ]. Investors are much more attuned to that degree of risk. After all if a company can’ t restructure it has to fail. ” There are more examples of solar adoption however. Much further north Freedom Cannabis tapped AltaPro Electric to design and install a 1.83 MW system atop its facility in Acheson Alberta in 2020. “ It’ s Canada’ s largest operational rooftop PV installation ” says AltaPro Chief Financial Officer David DeBruin. Freedom Cannabis is reaping the rewards from betting on solar. “ The margins in the indoor grow operations are very competitive and chopping down one of the largest opex [ operating expenditure ] items is a great way that Freedom Cannabis has been able to be a leader in the industry ” DeBruin tells pv magazine. He says other cannabis companies have made inquiries about solar but as in the US “ it seems the clients are held back due to financing becoming harder to attain from lenders. It’ s too bad because the cost of borrowing is dwarfed by the savings many times making any loan to install solar cash flow positive in year one. ” Cannabis is not limited to medical and recreational use. Hemp is one of the most versatile crops on the planet – and it’ s making a big comeback. As hemp is not grown for psychoactive component tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC) its farming is far less intensive and finicky than for example the high-THC flower grown by Canndescent in California. This makes hemp a potentially ideal agrivoltaic crop. In Melz Germany agrivoltaic developer SunFarming is currently trialing the cultivation of hemp under solar panels. “ All the plants without exception have grown well and developed excellently ” says Rafael Dulon founder and managing director of Hanf Farm. Dulon says the panels also help with mold a key concern for hemp farmers. Mold becomes a problem in autumn as temperatures cool and precipitation on the plants fails to dry. “ The rain protection for the plants provided by the PV system works wonderfully ” Dulon says. Another less-energy-intensive growing option is a greenhouse. However the need for natural sunlight makes rooftop solar less attractive on such structures. Building-integrated photovoltaics ( BIPV) are improving rapidly but products such as solar facades for greenhouses may be years away. In the meantime US-based nanomaterials innovator UbiQD’ s agricultural arm UbiGro – and solar panel manufacturer Heliene – have entered a joint development agreement for light-optimizing energy-producing modules designed for agrivoltaic greenhouses. UbiGro’ s translucent greenhouse film is integrated with photoluminescent particles that convert light into a preferable wavelength and can easily be combined with a solar module. UbiQD founder and CEO Hunter McDaniel tells pv magazine that if the panels only partially shade the greenhouse the yield lost to shading can be made up by the spectrum improvement provided by the film. McDaniel adds that while indoor growers have thus far managed to keep the scope of their energy intensity quiet – as opposed to similarly emergent energy-intensive industries such as crypto-mining – indoor growth is likely to shrink. Scientist Mills’ research supports this idea as the number of growers who operate primarily indoors fell from 80% to 60% between 2016 and 2020. With outdoor growth too inconsistent and indoor growth shrinking the hybrid option of greenhouses is likely to proliferate in the future. The cannabis industry trend of solar uptake is continuing in US states where the plant has been legalized more recently such as New York. Nate VerHague market development manager at New York-based installer Solar Liberty tells pv magazine the new cannabis market “ is going to have a ton of potential for solar. ” VerHague notes cannabis operations in New York state ( NYS) are only just getting up and running. “ There is going to be some extreme utility costs when it comes to electricity for these large operations ” he says. “ It is an ideal customer for solar as these facilities typically have a lot of roof space to utilize. ” While the nascent nature of the NYS market means Solar Liberty is yet to install PV for a cannabis company VerHague confirms the installer is “ in the quoting process with some organizations ” with the market looking promising from this year onward. National and regional governments the world over are shaping to follow in the footsteps of the US Canada Mexico Thailand Uruguay and others. Germany could legalize cannabis completely within a few years a development which would not only make it the world’ s single largest legal market but also considering its European centrality the world’ s “ dankest ” domino as neighbors would be expected to follow. Cannabis is becoming big business and given its energy needs could be big business for solar too. This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

       "      <td id=\"T_bce04_row0_col6\" class=\"data row0 col6\" >Cannabis prohibition drove a culture of clandestine production in the past and solar helped growers to cultivate it at remote off grid sites. Now as a global commercial cannabis market emerges solar has an even bigger role to play. Legal cannabis cultivation could be a big opportunity for solar. Solar energy and cannabis cultivation are old bedfellows. PV pioneer John Schaeffer has even credited solar with facilitating the northern California cannabis industry which in turn supported the nascent PV sector. Now as the legalization of medical and recreational cannabis gathers pace solar continues to perform a key role. Cannabis cultivation can take place outdoors indoors or in greenhouses. While outdoor cultivation worked for millennia the growth of the industry and increased demand for higher quality product  plus tight profit margins  have prompted producers to go indoors where ideal environments can be replicated. Indoor growth gives control over environmental factors and flowering periods. More importantly it means consistent year round harvests. However the high powered lights and the heating ventilation and air conditioning equipment needed to control temperature and humidity come with a Sasquatch sized carbon footprint. A 2022 report from the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime  UNODC estimated climate control measures represent more than 80 of the carbon footprint of indoor cannabis production. UNODC estimated that the carbon footprint is 16 times to 100 times larger than for outdoor cultivation. Indoor \" factory farming \" is incompatible with environmental social and corporate governance  ESG standards says Evan Mills principal at engineering consultancy Energy Associates and a former senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Mills spelled out the problem in a paper published in \" Energy Policy \" in 2012 the year Colorado and Washington state legalized cannabis and spurred a domino effect elsewhere. Even then he estimated indoor cultivation accounted for 1 of total US electricity use for a carbon footprint equivalent to three million cars. The scientist estimated 42 of cultivators grew exclusively indoors by 2020 often in multiple sprawling Walmart scale factories with energy consumption comparable to data centers. Unfortunately installing large scale solar on site isn' t an easy solution.
