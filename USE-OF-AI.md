## Use of AI Tools

Throughout this project, we actively integrated AI tools—specifically ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot—to support the development and optimization of our sentiment analysis system. These tools significantly enhanced our coding efficiency and problem-solving capabilities, allowing us to focus more on strategic tasks such as implementing and evaluating weak labeling techniques for improving model performance with limited labeled data.

### How AI Tools Supported Our Work

AI tools proved valuable in many aspects of our project:

- **Automating routine coding tasks**: We used GitHub Copilot to handle boilerplate and utility code directly within our IDE.
- **Debugging and error resolution**: ChatGPT helped us quickly identify and resolve code issues, especially when faced with challenging bugs.
- **Code architecture and optimization**: Both tools contributed to clean, maintainable code by assisting with refactoring and suggesting modular designs.

### Use of ChatGPT

ChatGPT served as a powerful assistant for our software engineering workflow. While it did not influence conceptual design decisions directly, it was particularly helpful in the following ways:

- **Answering technical questions**: For example, when we asked, *"How can we create a modular class structure for processing sentiment data?"*, ChatGPT provided clean and structured code suggestions.
- **Debugging assistance**: When encountering issues such as data preprocessing errors, we described the problem and received useful solutions quickly.
- **Brainstorming ideas**: It also supported us in generating creative ideas and new approaches to enhance the system.

Effective use required clearly describing the issue or request to receive actionable and relevant suggestions.

### Use of GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot streamlined our development by acting as a real-time coding assistant:

- **Inline code generation**: By typing a function signature or writing a comment like `# Generate embedding vector`, Copilot often completed the function effectively.
- **Code refactoring**: Suggestions based on comments like `# Refactor this code for readability` improved the clarity and performance of our code.

This allowed us to spend less time on repetitive tasks and more time on complex challenges.

### Evaluation and Impact

The integration of ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot greatly improved our development workflow. They accelerated coding, enabled faster debugging, and maintained a high code quality standard. 
This allowed us to concentrate on exploring weak labeling strategies, ultimately boosting model performance despite limited labeled data. The use of AI tools significantly contributed to the success 
of the project by ensuring efficiency, maintainability, and innovation.
